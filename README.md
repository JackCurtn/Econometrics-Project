# Econometrics-Project
A project as part of an Econometrics module for my Business Analytics MSc, to determine if GDP affects happiness

I used R and data from the World Happiness Report to create a linear regression model. What I found was that GDP per Capita does affect the average happiness of a country, but so does life expectancy and perceived social support.
